# Decorators Theory Content - Expansion Guide

## Current Status

The `decorators.json` file has been created with the following structure:

### ✅ Beginner Level (COMPLETE)
- **4,497 characters**
- **11 subsections**
- **9 comprehensive code examples**

Topics covered:
1. What is a Decorator?
2. First Decorator: Understanding the Basics
3. The @ Syntax
4. Decorators with Function Arguments
5. Universal Decorators with *args and **kwargs
6. Built-in Decorators (@property, @staticmethod, @classmethod)
7. Common Mistakes
8. Key Takeaways

### 🔄 Intermediate Level (OUTLINE)
- **656 characters** (structured outline)
- Ready for expansion with detailed content

Suggested topics to expand:
1. functools.wraps - preserving metadata
2. Parameterized decorators (decorator factories)
3. Practical parameterized decorators (timer, retry, rate limiter)
4. Decorator chaining/stacking
5. Class decorators (modifying classes)
6. Stateful decorators (maintaining state)
7. Method decorators vs function decorators
8. Common patterns (auth, logging, caching, debugging)

### 🔄 Advanced Level (OUTLINE)
- **473 characters** (structured outline)
- Ready for expansion with detailed content

Suggested topics to expand:
1. Deep dive: How decorators work under the hood
2. Understanding functools.wraps internals
3. Class-based decorators (callable classes)
4. Descriptor protocol for decorators
5. Async decorators
6. Advanced memoization techniques
7. Decorator composition
8. Performance optimization
9. Real-world patterns (deprecation, transactions, profiling)
10. Type-safe decorators

### 🔄 Cheatsheet (OUTLINE)
- **243 characters** (structured outline)
- Ready for expansion with detailed content

Suggested content:
1. Basic decorator template
2. Parameterized decorator template
3. Class-based decorator template
4. Common decorator patterns table
5. Quick reference: decorator syntax variations
6. Built-in decorators reference
7. Common mistakes and fixes
8. When to use what (decision matrix)
9. Debugging decorated functions
10. Performance tips

## Expansion Instructions

To expand the intermediate, advanced, and cheatsheet sections to match the beginner level quality:

1. Each section should have **7,000-15,000 characters**
2. Include **10-20 code examples** per section
3. Follow the markdown structure format
4. Use practical, real-world examples
5. Include "Common Mistakes" subsections
6. Add "Practice Exercises" where appropriate
7. Include "Key Takeaways" at the end

## Reference Files

Use these existing theory files as style references:
- `functions_advanced_content.json` - Similar complexity level
- `error_handling_guide.json` - Good example structure
- `python_data_types_structures.json` - Comprehensive examples

## Topics Coverage Checklist

- [x] Function decorators basics
- [x] Decorator syntax (@decorator)
- [ ] functools.wraps (mentioned, needs expansion)
- [ ] Parameterized decorators (mentioned, needs examples)
- [ ] Class decorators (mentioned, needs examples)
- [ ] Decorator chaining (mentioned, needs examples)
- [x] Built-in decorators (@property, @staticmethod, @classmethod)
- [x] Creating custom decorators

## Next Steps

1. Expand intermediate section with functools.wraps examples
2. Add parameterized decorator deep-dive
3. Include class decorator examples
4. Complete advanced section with async decorators
5. Fill out cheatsheet with quick reference templates
6. Add performance comparison examples
7. Include real-world use case examples
